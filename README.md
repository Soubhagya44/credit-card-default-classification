🧾 Project README Outline — Credit Card Default Classification
📌 1. Project Title

Credit Card Default Classification
A Machine Learning Project to Predict Credit Card Default Risk

📝 2. Project Description

A brief overview of what your project does:

This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will default on their credit card payment. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and prediction. The aim is to assist banks and financial institutions in mitigating credit risks. 
GitHub

🎯 3. Objective

Explain the goal of the project:

Predict credit card defaults using historical customer data.

Train one or more classification models.

Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score. 
Medium

(Optional) Deploy the model (e.g., as a web app).

📂 4. Dataset

Describe the dataset used:

Data Source: (e.g., UCI Default of Credit Card Clients, Kaggle)

Number of Records: ~30,000

Features:

Demographic (AGE, SEX, EDUCATION, MARRIAGE)

Credit details (LIMIT_BAL)

Payment history (PAY_0, PAY_2,... PAY_6)

Bill statements and previous payments

Target Variable: Default next month (0 = No, 1 = Yes) 
INSEAD Data Analytics

🔧 5. Tools & Tech Stack

List the main technologies you used:
